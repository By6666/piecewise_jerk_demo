# piecewise_jerk_demo

## introduction
This repo primtive achieve piecewise jerk algorithem base on apollo source code. Apollo code has universal interface for everyone but I only use part of it. So I simplified part of it.

* [osqp](https://osqp.org/)

* [matplotlib-cpp](https://github.com/lava/matplotlib-cpp)


### Tip
* apollo use osqp-0.4.1, if you want to using latest osqp(current 0.6.1), it should be noted that the input mode of kernel matrix is upper triangular.
